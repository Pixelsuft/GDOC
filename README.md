# GDOC
Geometry Dash Open-Source Cheat
# Building and Running
 - Copy `GDOC` dir to the GD dir <br />
 - Generate Project With CMake (Visual Studio, x32) <br />
 - Add all files from `src` dir to the project <br />
 - Build `Release`, `x86` <br />
 - Inject DLL to GD (but I prefer dll loaders like [GDDLLLOADER](https://github.com/adafcaefc/GDDllLoader))
